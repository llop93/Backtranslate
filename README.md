# Backtranslate
A simple code for biologists to backtranslate protein to DNA using your own customised codon usage, e.g. for design of mutants in a gene that has its own codon optimisation, where a given residue may be encoded by different codons throughout the sequence
This code is for experiments in which you may want to design DNA for a high number of mutants, each time changing a given number of residues in a protein, while maintaining the rest of the gene with the same sequence, which may have a customised codon usage
